Overview - 

I created a train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. My app will retrieve and manipulate this information with Moment.js. This website will provide up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.

Setup - 

I'm using Firebase to store data, GitHub to backup your project, and GitHub Pages to host your finished site.

Instructions -

When adding trains, System Administrators should be able to submit/add the following:
1) Train Name
2) Destination 
3) First Train Time -- in military time
4) Frequency -- in minutes
5) Calculate when the next train will arrive.  This is relative to the current time.
